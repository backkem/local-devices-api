      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Local Devices Protocol connects browsers to devices on the Local
        Area Network. Typically, these are devices such as NAS servers,
        Internet-connected TVs and IoT devices such as IP cameras, doorbells or
        thermostats.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entire specification assumes operation in an air-gapped Local Area
        Network. There can be no reliance on cloud or other remote servers for
        core functionality. The browser and devices should communicate directly
        and only make use of readily available network protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal is highly similar to that of the
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/User's-Guide"
          >Open Screen Protocol</a
        >. This specification therefore often refers to it.
